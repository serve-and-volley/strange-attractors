Strange Attractors
==================

Inspired by <a href="http://www.deanmcnamee.com/" target="_blank">Dean McNamee's</a> 3D rendering JavaScript library, <a href="http://deanm.github.com/pre3d/" target="_blank">Pre3D</a>, and his implementation of the <a href="http://deanm.github.com/pre3d/lorenz84.html" target="_blank">Lorenz-84 strange attractor</a>, I created my own implementations of various other strange attractors by modifying his code. Numerical solutions to the systems of non-linear ordinary differential equations are computed using both the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method to visually compare the differences.
